Mooday is a mood tracking journal SPA with quantitative and qualitative analysis features to support users in their journey towards understanding their mental health strengths and needs.

- Employed React, Router, Redux with MUI, styled-components, and CSS to construct three responsive views tied to a single Redux pipeline, allowing for standard storage, download, post, edit, sort, delete, and query of user journal entries.

- Incorporated Google Map Autocomplete to allow users to geotag the location of their story and lays the foundation for Mooday to provide a color-coded heatmap view of hot spots for various emotions using Map Markers. Users are also able to create and edit entries on the map directly.

- Custom built logic to extract metadata from queried redux journal entries that feed into three chart.JS components to provide users an interactive visual of journal trends with a bonus of flexibility for users to change year view.

- Integrated quickchart.io's word cloud API to supplement descriptive qualitative analysis to create a mixed-method service that integrates the benefit of both scientific approaches.
